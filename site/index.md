# About Me 

I am a hobbiest and tinkerer since 1989 at 6 when I became obsessed with electricity, electronics and computers. Without the required maths, I could not progress more than basic digital logic in electronics but I did learn programming on my PC/XT (8088) that had 640KB of RAM, a 20MB hard-disk and a 360KB floppy drive. Soon I was able to code in Quick Basic and also C along with dBase and Foxpro. I was somewhat of a power-user in DOS and such applications as Lotus 123 and Wordstar. Those applications and games that I was unable to have on my PC, I wrote myself. This included various paint-like programs that could create animations to use on games that I would create in Quick Basic or C and stretch to the maximum capabilities of my EGA card and the beautiful Hercules monitor. Amongst my exploits were business applications like accounting systems built from scratch and bus ticketing systems. I was not unknown and even starred in a TV show teaching programming.

Then I forgot that I am a coder and lived my teenage years exploring the world until circumstances required me to start working at 22 and rediscover my passion for programming. I was lucky to be involved in quite high technology projects and not the run-of-the-mill full-stack development. I worked on almost all layers of the stack above drivers. From embedded middleware, applications, connected devices and cloud services.

Then they made me a manager and saw my teams do development in certain ways; some of which did not seem quite right. As I grew in management, my ability to affect technology decisions became more democratic. There was no clear way for me to test out alternatives to group decisions and judge if my doubts were well founded. There were some experements I conducted recently to fill my gaps in knowledge and this will be the place where some of these excursions will be documented.

I hope this website will help me rediscover my passion once again and it inspires the visitor.
