# About Me 

I am a hobbiest and tinkerer since 1989 at 6 when I became obsessed with electricity, electronics and computers. Without the required maths, I could not progress more than basic digital logic in electronics but I did learn programming on my PC/XT (8088) that had 640KB of RAM, a 20MB hard-disk and a 360KB floppy drive. Soon I was able to code in Quick Basic and also C along with dBase and Foxpro. I was somewhat of a power-user in DOS and such applications as Lotus 123 and Wordstar. Those applications and games that I was unable to have on my PC, I wrote myself. This included various paint-like programs that could create animations to use on games that I would create in Quick Basic or C and stretch to the maximum capabilities of my EGA card and the beautiful Hercules monitor. Amongst my exploits were business applications like accounting systems built from scratch and bus ticketing systems. I was not unknown and even starred in a TV show teaching programming.

Then I forgot that I am a coder and lived my teenage years exploring the world until circumstances required me to start working at 22 and rediscover my passion for programming. I was lucky to be involved in reasonably high technology projects. I worked on almost all layers of the stack above drivers. From middleware running on RTOS and embedded Linux, applications, connected devices and cloud services.

From a long time I am a manager and not sufficiently hands-on as to satisfy my technical curiosity. There were some experements I conducted recently and continue to perform to fill some gaps in my knowledge and this will be the place where some of these excursions will be documented. I hope this humble website inspires and illuminates the visitor.

### ðŸ“„ [How This Website Came Into Existence](./homepi-cicd-pipeline.md "CI/CD pipeline exploration for Pi 5 server")

Grasp basic DevOps, IaC and CI/CD concepts with this tutorial. I was a complete novice in tools like Ansible, Terraform, Kubernetes and Github Actions. I believe this is a solid starting point that should clear some concepts about mordern infrastructure automation practices.
