# About Me 

I am a hobbiest and tinkerer since 1989 at 6 when I became obsessed with electricity, electronics and computers. Without the required fundamentals in maths, I could not progress more than basic digital logic in electronics but I did learn programming on themy PC/XT (8088) that my dad bought for me with a modest 640KB of RAM, a 20MB hard-disk and a 360KB floppy drive. Soon I was able to code in Quick Basic and also C along with dBase and Foxpro. I was somewhat of a power-user in DOS and such applications as Lotus 123 and Wordstar. Those applications and games that I did not have on my PC, I wrote by myself. My creations included various paint-like programs that could be used to make animations like dinasour sprites to use on games that I would code in Quick Basic or C and utilize the maximum capabilities of my CGA card and a beautiful Hercules monitor. Amongst my exploits were business applications like an accounting system and a bus ticketing system built from scratch. I was not completely unknown and made a lot of technically minded elder friends who mentored me and I even starred in a TV show teaching programming in GW-BASIC.

Then I forgot that I am a coder and lived my teenage years exploring the world until circumstances required me to start working at 22 and rediscover my passion for programming. I was lucky to be involved in reasonably high technology projects. I worked on almost all layers of the stack above drivers. From middleware running on RTOS and embedded Linux, applications, connected devices and cloud services. I worked in various domains like digital cinema, digital video broadcasting, digital signage, video streaming (VOD/OTT), internet-of-things (IoT), AI and proptech SaaS.

I was made a manager and soon found myself not sufficiently hands-on as to satisfy my technical curiosity. There were some experements I conducted recently and continue to perform to fill some gaps in my knowledge and this will be the place where some of these excursions will be documented. I hope this humble website inspires and illuminates the visitor.

## ðŸš€ Some Articles to Kick Off This Website

### ðŸ“„ [How This Website Came Into Existence - CI/CD and IaC on a Raspberry Pi](./homepi-cicd-pipeline.md "CI/CD pipeline exploration for Pi 5 server")

Grasp basic DevOps, IaC and CI/CD concepts with this tutorial. I was a complete novice in tools like Ansible, Terraform, Kubernetes and Github Actions. I believe this is a solid starting point that should clear some concepts about mordern infrastructure automation practices.
